# 📝 Task Management Homework Assignment 📝

👋 Hey there, future coding heroes! My name is Pourya, your Django drill sergeant for Bootcamp 98! Together, we'll conquer the world of codes, errors. Get ready to flex those coding muscles, and have a blast with this task management project! 🎉💪

## 🤪 The Tale of Task Chaos 🤪

Once upon a time, in the realm of infinite codes, there lived a toilful teacher named Pourya. Like a juggler in a circus, Pourya was always balancing a myriad of projects and assignments, desperately needing a way to keep track of the relentless tasks. But, fret not! This is where you, the brave knights of code, come in! 🎩🐉

Pourya needs your help to build a task management web application using Django. With a mountain of tasks to handle, the application needs to be robust, capable of handling a flood of data. Moreover, Pourya desires the application to be a sight for sore eyes, boasting a clean, modern design that screams "professional". 🚀

## 📝 The Epic Quest 📝

Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to craft a simple yet elegant task management web application using Django, and the trusty companions of front-end development – HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Here's the magical spellbook of features that Pourya seeks: 🔮

1. **The All-Seeing Eye:** Users should be able to view all tasks on the homepage.
2. **The Oracle's Vision:** Users should be able to search tasks by title or tag.
3. **The Task's Tale:** Users should be able to view individual tasks on a separate page.
4. **The Navigator's Compass:** The site should have a navigation bar with links to the homepage, a page for searching tasks, and a page for viewing all tasks.
5. **The Aesthetic Appeal:** The site should use Bootstrap to make the UI look polished and professional.

Implement models and relationships as follows:

- **The Task:** A model with title, description, due date, and status fields.
- **The Category:** A model with a one-to-many relationship to Task.
- **The Tag:** A model with a many-to-many relationship to Task.

Your journey also includes mastering the art of implementing perfect responsive HTML, ensuring that the site looks splendid on devices of all sizes. This crucial aspect of web development will be a key factor in your quest's scoring. 🏹🎯

Apart from implementing the magical features, your mission includes painting a smile on Pourya's face by making the application look professional and polished, with a clean and modern design. Make use of the powerful Django admin panel to create, edit, and delete tasks, categories, and tags. 🖌️🎨

**Remember, brave knights!** The most glory will be awarded for front-end tasks, so put in that extra muscle to make the design look like a Picasso painting!

All views must be function-based views that either get all objects or get one object's details. Now, let's get coding, and may the semicolons be ever in your favor! 🧙‍♂️💻🎈
